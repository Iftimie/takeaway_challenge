# Takeaway Service

A take-home backend built one small milestone at a time. Currently exposes only
`GET /health`, returning HTTP 200 with `{"status":"ok"}`. This checks application
liveness, not database readiness.

## Setup (Windows PowerShell)

Requires Python 3.11 or newer. Run commands from the project root:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -e ".[test]"
```

The virtual environment isolates this project's dependencies. The editable
install (`-e`) makes source changes available without reinstalling the project;
`[test]` includes pytest and HTTPX. Calling the environment's Python directly
avoids needing to activate it or change PowerShell execution policy.

## Run

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Uvicorn serves the FastAPI application: `app.main:app` means the `app` object in
`app/main.py`. `--reload` restarts it after source edits during development.
Stop it with Ctrl+C.

In another PowerShell terminal:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
```

Expected result: `status` is `ok`. Interactive API documentation is available at
[http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs).

## Test

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q
```

The health test checks the HTTP status and JSON body through FastAPI's
`TestClient`; no running server is needed. See the
[FastAPI testing guide](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/testing/).

## Local PostgreSQL

Requires Docker Desktop running with Linux containers (or an equivalent Docker
Engine with Compose). Verify `docker compose version` and `docker info` work.
Database sessions and Alembic use this database; the health endpoint remains
independent of it.

If Docker reports that the `docker_engine` pipe is missing, start Docker Desktop
and select its Linux context before running the commands below:

```powershell
docker desktop start
docker context use desktop-linux
docker info
```

The context selects which engine receives Docker commands. Alternatively, use
`docker --context desktop-linux compose ...` for an individual command.
After installing Desktop, reopen your terminal so it picks up PATH changes. If
an older terminal cannot find `docker-credential-desktop`, this per-user install
can be added to that terminal's PATH:

```powershell
$env:PATH = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\DockerDesktop\resources\bin;" + $env:PATH
```

Create the local configuration once; keep an existing `.env` if you have one:

```powershell
if (-not (Test-Path .env)) { Copy-Item .env.example .env }
docker compose config --quiet
docker compose up -d --wait db
docker compose ps
```

Expected: `db` reports healthy. The first startup downloads the PostgreSQL image.
Compose reads `.env` for the database name, user, password, and host port. The
example credentials are for local development only; `.env` is ignored by Git.
The port is bound to `127.0.0.1`, so it is accessible only from this computer.
If port 5432 is occupied, change `POSTGRES_PORT` in `.env`.

We use `postgres:17` to stay on one major version while allowing patch updates.
A named volume, `postgres_data`, stores database files independently of the
container. The health check uses `pg_isready` to check whether PostgreSQL is
accepting connections; it does not verify application schemas or credentials.
The `$$` in the health-check command lets the container expand its variables.

Run a query using the container's database client:

```powershell
docker compose exec db sh -c 'psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$POSTGRES_DB" -c "SELECT 1;"'
```

Expected: one row containing `1`. The shell expands the user/database values
inside the container, so this also works if you edited `.env`.

### Verify persistence

Create a small probe table separate from application tables:

```powershell
docker compose exec db sh -c 'psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$POSTGRES_DB" -c "CREATE TABLE milestone2_probe (id integer PRIMARY KEY); INSERT INTO milestone2_probe VALUES (1);"'
docker compose down
docker compose up -d --wait db
docker compose exec db sh -c 'psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$POSTGRES_DB" -c "SELECT id FROM milestone2_probe;"'
```

Expected: the row containing `1` survives container removal and recreation.
After verifying it, remove only the probe table:

```powershell
docker compose exec db sh -c 'psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$POSTGRES_DB" -c "DROP TABLE milestone2_probe;"'
```

Stop the local database with `docker compose down`. This preserves the volume;
adding `--volumes` would delete its data. Initial database/user/password settings
apply only when the volume is empty; editing `.env` does not update credentials
in an existing database. The bootstrap user is a database superuser for this
local setup, not a production application account. See the
[official PostgreSQL image documentation](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres).

## Database sessions and migrations

After updating the code, install the added dependencies:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -e ".[test]"
```

`app/config.py` reads the same `POSTGRES_*` values as Compose from `.env`.
Environment variables take precedence. Python defaults `POSTGRES_HOST` to
`127.0.0.1`, so an existing milestone 2 `.env` still works. Run Python and Alembic
commands from the project root so they find `.env`. Restart Python processes
after configuration changes.

Pydantic Settings validates configuration. SQLAlchemy builds the connection URL
from separate values, so special characters in passwords do not need manual URL
encoding. Psycopg is the PostgreSQL driver; its binary package avoids local
compiler setup on Windows.

`app/db.py` creates one cached engine (a connection pool) when first needed.
`get_session` provides a session for future FastAPI dependencies. The `with`
block closes it even when a request fails, rolling back unfinished work. Features
must commit successful writes explicitly. No endpoint uses a session yet.
See [SQLAlchemy session basics](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/orm/session_basics.html).

With PostgreSQL running, apply migrations before running database tests:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m alembic upgrade head
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q -m integration
```

Expected: `10 passed, 1 deselected`. Tests check connectivity and user-table
constraints. User tests insert rows inside transactions and roll them back after
each test. The default `pytest -q` command excludes integration tests; it still
runs the health test without Docker. To run all tests:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q -m "integration or not integration"
```

Expected: `11 passed` when PostgreSQL is running and migrations are applied.

Alembic records ordered schema changes as revision files in `migrations/versions`.
It shares the application's settings and engine; credentials are not stored in
`alembic.ini`. Verify that it connects:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m alembic current -v
```

Expected: revision `0001 (head)` after upgrading. `upgrade head` applies pending
migrations; running it again does not recreate the table. `alembic check` compares
the database schema with the model and should report no new upgrade operations.
`app.models` is imported in the migration environment to register model metadata.
See the [Alembic tutorial](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/tutorial.html).

## User model

`app/models.py` defines how a Python `User` maps to a row in `users`.
Migration `0001` creates the actual table; defining a model alone does not create
tables. The database assigns integer IDs and enforces unique emails, non-null
email/password hash/role/name, and roles limited to `customer`, `staff`, `admin`.
`default_address` is optional. The role must be supplied explicitly.

A CHECK constraint validates the role even for SQL written outside the app.
The unique email constraint also creates an index, so no extra email index is
needed. Email comparison is currently case-sensitive; normalization and email
format validation will be decided for registration. Required text columns reject
NULL, but do not yet reject empty strings. Password hashing is not implemented
here; the model only stores the hash that registration will eventually generate.

The migration includes a downgrade that drops `users`, which would delete user
data. Do not use downgrade on data you need to keep. No registration or login
endpoint has been added in this milestone.

## Project notes

See `AGENTS.md` for the working agreement and `PROGRESS.md` for decisions,
milestones, and review status. Registration, authentication, and full deployment
belong to later milestones.
